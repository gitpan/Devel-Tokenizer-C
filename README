1. DESCRIPTION
--------------

The Devel::Tokenizer::C module provides a small class for creating
the essential ANSI C source code for a fast keyword tokenizer.

The generated code is optimized for speed. On the ANSI-C keyword
set, it's 2-3 times faster than equivalent code generated with the
gprof utility.

---------------
2. INSTALLATION
---------------

Installation of the Devel::Tokenizer::C module follows the standard
Perl Way and should not be harder than:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note that you may need to become superuser to 'make install'.

If you're building the module under Windows, you may need to use a
different make program, such as 'nmake', instead of 'make'.
